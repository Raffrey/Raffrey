### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Design majoring in Information Environments at the University of Queensland. <br>
I am working on building my skills as a UX/UI Designer and as a Web Developer. I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python to get me started. I strive to learn something new everyday, no matter how small or momentous.
